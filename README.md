QA Java Automation Code Challenge #6 (Crawler):

Write a crawler that will automatically navigate to every page on the site.

Go to https://www.skiutah.com/

Build a crawler that will start at www.skiutah.com and finds every link/page and goes to that page and finds
other pages it needs to visit.  Remember to not visit the same page twice and to only visit the pages on the domain.

The sample code stub is found in the Utils.java file.


"Refer to the Git_Procedure_Step_By_Step document, which contains detailed instructions for accessing code stubs and submitting completed work from/to GitHub."
